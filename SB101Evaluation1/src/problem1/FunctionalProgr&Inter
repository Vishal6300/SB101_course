 What do you mean by Functional programming and Functional interface?

 Functional Programming:- Functional programming is nothing but a style of programming,
 that promotes pure functions. By pure function, I mean a piece of code that takes
 some input, performs computations, and gives the desired output.
 
 It also helps in writing the code clear and concise, which is easily maintainable.
 It allows easier use of APIs and libraries.
 
 Functional Interface:- An Interface that contains exactly one abstract method is known as 
 functional interface. It can have any number of default, static methods but can contain 
 only one abstract method. 
 It can also declare methods of object class.
 It is also known as Single Abstract Method Interfaces or SAM Interfaces.

Advantages of Java
Java is an Object-Oriented and a general-purpose programming language that helps to create programs and
applications on any platform. Java comes up with a bundle of advantages that lets you stick with it.


1. Java is Simple. Any language can be considered as simple if it is easy to learn and understand.
The syntax of Java is straightforward, easy to write, learn, maintain, and understand, the code is easily debuggable.

Moreover, Java is less complex than the languages like C and C++,
because many of the complex features of these languages are being
removed from Java such as explicit pointers concept, storage classes, operator overloading, and many more.

2. Java is an Object-Oriented Programming language
Java is an object-oriented language that helps us to enhance the flexibility and
reusability of the code. Using the OOPs concept, we can easily reuse the object in other programs.

It also helps us to increase security by binding the data and functions into a
single unit and not letting it be accessed by the outside world.
It also helps to organize the bigger modules into smaller ones so they are easy to understand.

3. Java is a secure language
Java reduces security threats and risks by avoiding the use of explicit pointers.
A pointer stores the memory address of another value that can cause unauthorized access to memory.

This issue is resolved by removing the concept of pointers.
Also, there is a Security manager in Java for each application that allows us to define the access rules for classes.

4. Java is cheap and economical to maintain
Java programs are cheap to develop and maintain as these programs are dependent
on a specific hardware infrastructure to run. We can easily execute them on any machine that reduces the extra cost to maintain.

5. Java is platform-independent
Java offers a very effective boon to its users by providing the feature of
platform independence that is Write Once Run Anywhere(WORA) feature.

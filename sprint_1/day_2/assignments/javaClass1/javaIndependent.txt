Why is Java known as a platform independent language?
Java is platform-independent because it uses a virtual machine.
The Java programming language and all APIs are compiled into bytecodes.
Bytecodes are effectively platform-independent.
The virtual machine takes care of the differences between the bytecodes for the different platforms.
